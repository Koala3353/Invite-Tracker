# Invite Tracker
A really simple discord bot that works as a referral system for a discord server. It uses SQLite to store and increment the invite counts. 

# What it does
1.) Makes a custom code for a user to invite his friend.

2.) Friend joins and send code to a channel

3.) Gives credit to the inviter
